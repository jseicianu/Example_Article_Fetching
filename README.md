# Example_Article_Fetching
Resilient article fetcher with multi-strategy extraction and automatic fallbacks (Requests→Trafilatura→Selenium→BeautifulSoup), plus retries, backoff, and structured output.
Overview

This tool ingests online articles from a list of URLs and extracts clean, structured text using multiple methods with automatic fallbacks.
It was designed for large-scale open-source intelligence (OSINT) monitoring, where reliability, automation, and clean text are critical.

# How It Works

The fetcher:

Prefilters URLs (removes known paywalls, social/video platforms, and excluded patterns).

Fetches HTML with requests (standard headers and redirects handled).

Extracts content using an ensemble of methods:

readability-lxml

trafilatura

Domain-specific rules

BeautifulSoup fallback for generic article containers

Evaluates quality (junk filter, “content quality score” gates, duplicate detection, garble detection).

Falls back to Selenium when sites return 403 errors or block normal requests.

Returns structured results with metadata (title, authors, date, method used, CQS metrics, status codes).

# Keep in Mind

Some helper modules (app_config, ensemble_extractor, content_extractor, etc.) are assumed to exist.

The Selenium fallback requires a configured driver pool (selenium_helper.POOL).

This snippet emphasizes resilience and automation—real-world performance depends on environment setup (drivers, configs, network conditions).

Robots.txt awareness, backoff logic, and user-agent rotation can be layered on if needed.
